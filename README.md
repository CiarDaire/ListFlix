This was for university project. It is more of a starting foundation than a fully developed application.

The objective of this application and project was to learn how to connect user authentication to Firebase and create/manage SQLite databases, alongside 
general practice of React Native and Expo. 

In hindsight, SQLite is not what I would choose to create another initial database for future projects, but otherwise I'm happy to have a better understanding
of how to create and manage SQLite tables and data.
